        <h1 class="text-warning bg-dark p-2">What is a dental cleaning?</h1>
        <p style="font-weight:bold;">
            Part of preventive dentistry, routine dental exams and dental cleanings are the building blocks of long-term
            oral health. A dental cleaning helps keep teeth and gums in optimal condition by preventing the accumulation
            of plaque and tartar, which left untreated, can lead to tooth decay, gum disease and potentially even tooth
            loss. Rather than waiting for problems to arise, preventive dentistry uses routine exams, dental cleanings,
            digital X-rays and other treatments, as well as patient education, to keep issues at bay.
        </p>
        <h1 class="text-warning bg-dark p-2">What are plaque and tartar?</h1>
        <p style="font-weight:bold;">Plaque is an accumulation of bacteria, food and by-products from the bacteria on
            the teeth and gums. This accumulation leads to the formation of cavities and gingival inflammation that
            leads to problems such as tenderness, swelling and bleeding. Tartar, on the other hand, is plaque that has
            hardened onto the enamel of the teeth and under the gum line from minerals in your saliva. Accumulation of
            tartar leads to gingival inflammation, gingival recession and eventual bone loss around the teeth. A regular
            dental cleaning removes both plaque and tartar from the teeth.</p>
        <h1 class="text-warning bg-dark p-2">What is a dental exam?</h1>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">During a dental exam, a dentist will examine your oral environment. This includes
            teeth and their roots, the surrounding gingiva and bones, your bite and how you chew as well as the general
            appearance of your teeth looking for stains, chips, gaps, crowding and any potential issues. Muscles, lymph
            nodes and tongue will be checked for inflammation or abnormalities. Your dentist and hygienist will also
            screen for signs of oral cancer. If you’re nervous about visiting a dentist for the first time or experience
            dental anxiety, tell your dentist how you feel and what your concerns are (fear of the unknown, a previous
            bad experience, sensitive teeth, pain, etc.) so they can help put you at ease.</p>
        <h1 class="text-warning bg-dark p-2">What happens during a first visit to the dentist?</h1>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">In addition to a complete examination of your teeth, gums and jaw, the dentist may
            also take an X-ray to look for problems beneath the surface of your teeth and gums, all the way to the
            bones. A dental cleaning may also be scheduled.</p>
        <h1 class="text-warning bg-dark p-2">What are the steps of a regular dental cleaning?</h1>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">To start, the hygienist will use special tools designed to remove the plaque and
            tartar that have accumulated, and hardened, onto your teeth and gums. This step is called scaling or root
            planing.

            Secondly, a power polisher will be used to clean and polish the surface of your teeth, removing any
            temporary stains caused by eating, drinking and smoking. With extensive staining, an air abrasion unit may
            be required to remove them. Third, you’ll be treated to professional flossing, both to remove any leftover
            debris and to help teach you
            the proper way to floss at home. The dentist may recommend a fluoride treatment, depending on the patient’s
            age or with increased risk to
            dental decay from the condition of their teeth, and X-rays to show the roots of their teeth and bone to
            detect any issues hiding under the gums, to diagnose for decay (cavities), assess impacted teeth and to
            assess for any bone pathologies.</p>
        <h1 class="text-warning bg-dark p-2">Why is it important to go for routine dental cleanings?</h1>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">A regularly scheduled dental cleaning can make the difference between a healthy,
            white smile and one that needs a lot of work. In addition to keeping teeth and gums in optimal condition,
            routine dental cleanings also help keep teeth free of plaque, tartar and temporary surface stains. Oral
            health is very strongly linked with total body health; periodontal disease is linked to heart disease,
            gum disease can lead to premature births and gastric (stomach) issues are often first diagnosed though the
            mouth.</p>
        <h1 class="text-warning bg-dark p-2">How much does a dental cleaning cost?</h1>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Exams and dental cleanings are routine procedures, so they cost a lot less than
            the treatments and/or procedures that might need to be done in their place if proper dental health isn’t
            maintained. Variables that could end up having an effect on the price of a dental cleaning include the
            patient’s overall dental health, if they require sedation (due to dental anxiety or sensitive teeth) and if
            additional procedures/treatments are required, such as fluoride and/or X-rays.</p>
